## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#Load libraries that are required
library(rtweet)
library(twitteR)

#Setting up authentication to access twitter for Q13
key = "COghWIH9VbXOtQI6m9xrSbOVN"
secret = "f0M4L0oMsvGpxcdb7MycEwxyyJC7Hub29hjnVUTEUO7oKeufsx"
access_tokens = "2388475730-lZ4Yqs8Jd3XtKZZQoTOz3wcYjypHbbnHKjwAQE1"
access_secret = "uHZHaALuELTlITgvJXR7PuG1pYGk8297RNGr8cUspO2C9"
setup_twitter_oauth(key, secret, access_tokens, access_secret)

#11
#Reading the tweets.rds file
tweets = readRDS("tweets.rds")

#Attaching the tweets to make it into a global variable
attach(tweets)

#Storing the attached tweets into its own dataset with it now being reordered to descending
top100 <- tweets[order(retweet_count, decreasing=TRUE)[1:100] ,] 

#Getting only the retweets texts from the "top100" dataset and storing the retweets into in own variable set.
top100.retweeted=top100[1:100, c("retweet_text")]

#Removing all duplicates tweets to only show the most common tweets that were retweeted
unq.top100Retweeted <-top100.retweeted [! duplicated( top100.retweeted) ]

#Printing the top100 retweets with no duplicates
print(unq.top100Retweeted)

#12
#By using the "top100" dataset, we store all the users that tweeted in the top 100 in a variable set
UsersOfTweets=top100[1:100, c("screen_name")]

#Printing all the users to identify the users
print(UsersOfTweets)

#13
#By using the "UsersOfTweets" variable data set we search all of the users and gather all their data and store it in the variable set "UsersData"
UsersData <- lookupUsers(UsersOfTweets)

#Using the "sapply" function we extract the follower counts of all the users and store it in a variable set "followersCounts"
followerCounts = sapply(UsersData, function(x) x$followersCount)

#Using the "sapply" function we extract the statuses counts of all the users and store it in a variable set "statusesCounts"
statusesCounts = sapply(UsersData, function(x) x$statusesCount)

#Printing the followercounts of all users
print (followerCounts)

#Printing all the statuses counts of all users
print (statusesCounts)

#14
#Via the use of dataframe, we use the previously saved variable data sets and use the chiq.test function to determine the relationship
User.data <- data.frame(followerCounts, statusesCounts)

#Printing the dataframe to identify the dataset to be used for the chiq.test
print(User.data)

#According to the chi-square test, the relationship between status counts and followers counts has no association as the p-value is <0.01, they are independent from each other. In this case we reject the alternative hypothesis
print(chisq.test(User.data))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
